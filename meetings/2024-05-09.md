## 📝 Meeting Notes
### 1. Enhancements and Issues in Network Protocol Management
* **Boot Node Issues**
    Discussion about problems with the boot node and the high number of requests it received, which was a major focus for resolution.
* **P2P Code Updates**
    Review of changes in the P2P code on the development branch compared to the main branch, focusing on the creation of the P2P host and updates in the connection manager.
* **Configuration Enhancements**
    Introduction of new configuration parameters in the development branch for better management of network connections, including low and high watermark thresholds.
* **Syncing Logs**
    Concerns raised about the excessive logging of out-of-sync messages during node synchronization, which may not be necessary.
* **Block Download Method**
    Discussion on the safety and efficiency of downloading blocks by number versus by hash, with a recommendation to switch to hash-based downloading.
* **Conclusion**
> 1. Issue identified and presumably fixed, though details of the resolution are not fully discussed.
> 2. Significant upgrades have been made, including manual management of connection instances and enhanced configuration options.
> 3. Suggestion to reduce or change the log level for these messages to debug to avoid clutter.
> 4. Advised to refactor the code to implement block downloading by hash to ensure validity and security.
### 2. Technical Challenges and Solutions in Network Management and Development
* **P2P Changes**
    Discussion about the P2P changes and their impact on the DrHarmony's reset connection function. Concerns were raised about the need for adjustments in the new setup.
* **Boot Node Failures**
    Investigation of boot node failures, particularly node number 4, which was failing constantly. The issue was suspected to be environmental, and changing the port temporarily alleviated the problem without a permanent fix.
* **Sync Issues**
    Discussion on sync issues affecting validators and nodes, with a focus on the inability to maintain sync and the legacy sync system's role.
* **Blockchain Explorer Options**
    Evaluation of new blockchain explorer options like Blockscan, considering features, pricing, and the necessity of open-source code as per project guidelines.
* **Developer Engagement**
    Strategies to attract more developers to generate traffic and utilize APIs, with a mention of the current market dynamics and advertising trends.
* **Conclusion**
> 1. Changing the port did not resolve the underlying issue as failures were triggered by client connections.
> 2. Further follow-ups required to align with open-source requirements and finalize the explorer choice.
### 3. Improving Efficiency in Blockchain Protocols
* **Crosslink Project**
    Constantine discussed his recent work on the Crosslink project, expressing uncertainty about his ability to complete it.
* **Blockchain Consensus Protocol**
    Researching a new blockchain consensus protocol that could potentially operate two times faster than the current one by requiring only one step.
* **Rust Implementation**
    Found a Rust implementation of the protocol, noting that it appears cleaner and possibly more effective than the existing Go implementation.
### 4. Addressing technical issues and planning for HIP32 release
* **Technical Issues**
    Discussion of various technical issues including crusting, boot node problems, and stream sync. Focus on the crosslink issue as it is critical for HIP32.
* **Testnet and Devnet**
    Issues with testnet similar to devnet were discussed, particularly the communication of signatures from shard1 to shard0.
* **HIP32 Release**
    Estimation of the timeframe for releasing HIP32 given the current technical issues, with a primary focus on resolving the crosslink issue.
* **DeFi Incentives**
    Adam is reacquainting with DeFi incentives, exploring what the current push entails and determining necessary actions versus current capabilities.
 **Conclusion**
> 1. Three weeks needed after resolving the crosslink issue to schedule the mainnet hard fork.
