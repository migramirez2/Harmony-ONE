### Summary
GMX strikes a balance between leverage, platform features, and multi-chain flexibility, making it an attractive option for traders. On the other hand, Jupiter targets traders aiming for the highest potential returns (and risks) with its 100x leverage on the Solana network. However, its limited functionality and token selection could be perceived as drawbacks.
