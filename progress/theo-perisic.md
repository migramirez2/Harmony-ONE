Until a clear structure for q2, I will ignore daily tasks until these larger objectives are completed. Notified Encode of our cancellation of the hackathon due to our prioritization of further developing DeFi infrastructure and AI data.

---

2024-04-28 Sun (1.0h): Scheduling call during upcoming week with Amanda.

2024-04-27 Sat (2.0h): Research on intent based contract interactions, looking to bring this to 1bot, or Harmony Portfolio. Harmony users should have a seamless way of navigating DeFi across all chains in ONE location, this is the basis of something we can build based on the tools we have with 1bot on telegram and Harmony Portfolio web app, main worry is prioritization and product direction get in the way of either one reaching completion. 

2024-04-26 Fri: Off boarding Theo with Amanda, finalizing resources for Zi’s layer 3, prepared for twitter space. 

2024-04-25 Thu: Encode funding discussions for web3 + AI hackathon, research and suggestions for Harmony Defi: complete Harmony Portfolio to have the essential defi primitives all in ONE seamless location, then add a perpetual dex with LP tokens for community to earn generated fees as well as trader fees.

---

2024-04-21 Sun (1.0h): Harmony AI docs.

2024-04-20 Sat (5.0h): Spent time assigning and detailing Q2 deliverables. As we are now one month into Q2, it's crucial that we have a stable set of objectives to ensure we meet our goals. I suggest that ongoing tasks either be prioritized for completion or clearly identified as discontinued. This approach will help us avoid any ambiguity in our direction and ensure that all products are completed to a higher standard.

2024-04-19 Fri: Clearing offices.

2024-04-18 Thu: Drafted team Q2 assignments. Started 1Bot doc for real-time Harmony information with Tenacious. Coordination with Protofire for Lend. Insight: Lend needs additional liquidity for the automated money market to flow smoother, suggestion 10k USD total split accross each provided token.

2024-04-17 Wed: Meeting with Encode for AI/Crypto hackathon for pricing and potential outcomes. Attended ONE show.

2024-04-16 Tue: Continued Encode discussion for AI and Crypto developments. Updated deliverables. Discussed alternative approach to product development with user focus with Stephen.

---

2024-04-14 Sun (3.0h): Research for Bitcoin and Runes. Insights: programmability of bitcoin will continue to increase, chasing bitcoin would not lead to ideal results, better path is building infrastructure that allows people to easily navigate bitcoin as their fees become far too high and the network gets congested.

2024-04-13 Sat (1.0h): Community outreach.

2024-04-12 Fri: Meeting with Encode for developer relations. Insights: Potential inclusion of Harmony in AI and crypto hackathons. PRD for ONE Resume.

2024-04-08 Mon: Q1 review for % split. Coordination for /progress, replacing new 2-week deliverables. Check in with Protofire for Blockscout, Lend, and potential for incentivized token for governance on Lend with % fee sharing from my original proposal.

---

2024-04-07 Sun (2.0h): Looked into [open source local](https://clusteredbytes.pages.dev/posts/2024/fully-local-chat-with-pdf-app-using-llamaindex-ollama-nextjs/) frameworks to test for an open source version of ONE Resume without the need of Claude. Insight: not as consistent but with sufficient training this can be solved, cost would be removed.

2024-04-06 Sat (3.0h): Continued testing of Jobscan AI tooling. Insight: not very accurate scoring or ability to reach higher scoring using their suggestions, feels like a worse grammarly but for resumes, focused on keyword additions rather than honest review. 

2024-04-05 Fri: Opened communications with [Ta Da](https://ta-da.io/) to verify “Decentralized workforce enables high-volume, cost-effective, and region-specific data collection”.

2024-04-04 Thu: Sync with Protofire on Blockscout. Update: Cross Shard Transactions, ETA Monday. Staking Transactions, ETA end of next week. Iteration and sync with Stephen for 2-week deliverables.  

2024-04-03 Wed: First iteration for team deliverables due 4/19. Further dive into [CryptoKoryo](https://harmonyone.notion.site/CryptoKoryo-AI-Data-on-Chain-66d1e2bdf6dd4a38a1e9e1b7ef773441?pvs=4) report. Insight: interesting concepts but no sign of adoption yet, also no metrics leading to clear model improvements.

Q1 Review:

In Q1, I managed and helped launch 4 distinct projects: Human-Protocol, Quest Lottery, Lend, and Flip. For each project I contributed to the product through UI/UX iterations, userflows, and minor frontend pushes, as well as operations by coordinating 12 individuals, 5 internal, 4 from the apps team, and 3 from protofire. I also extended this coordination to our community, helping the 7 recovery multisig custodians who increased recovery percentage by 6%, the most in a single quarter, and the 60+ eligible validator community for HIP-32 leading to a unanimous YES vote with 3 billion ONE.

I also released the 2024 roadmap, engaged in twitter spaces and EthDenver, promoted 7 ecosystem projects, and onboarded a new infrastructure partner, Envio. The campaign with the OneScription team, led to their sold out inscription token, raising 1.8 million ONE. On my own time, I also attended 5 bi-weekly Harmony Ecosystem Roundup spaces to engage with the community.

7 ecosystem project promotions: Galaxii, a decentralized TikTok alternative; MetaSMS, an encrypted messenger; Joskins, a platform for purchasing merch with ONE tokens; Knights&Peasants, a strategy blockchain game; OneScription, a gateway for converting Harmony inscriptions to ERC-20 tokens; AnotherWorld, a Ready Player One-inspired metaverse; and Coherence, an NFT marketplace.

Built and tested resume analyzer using claude 3 api against Julia's resume. Conistent in scoring, short paragraph description, and 3 suggestions based on job description.

---

2024-03-24 Sun: Research on predictions market for salary. Insight: Thales has a simple UX but only supports up/down market. Overtime markets supports only sports betting, but their support for games is extensive. Polymarket covers the widest options with popular categories including elections, box office, sports, ETF approvals, etc. no markets for salary on any platform. [2hr]

2024-03-23 Sat: Changed opus outputs to provide suggestions for resume improvements. Insights: base Claude still needs small adjustments, I.e. “more concise” “single sentences” “follow job description precisely” to yield best results. [3hr]

2024-03-22 Fri: Troubleshooting bridge with Galaxii, sync with protofire for blockscout progress. UI/UX work with Alaina for Buy/Bridge page of Harmony Portfolio.

2024-03-21 Thu: Attended TGI AI. Claude 3 resume testing and Harmony Portfolio iterations. Insights: base model is strong but tends to be verbose, small prompting creates structure consistency, but api structure would be best to deliver consistent match results.

2024-03-20 Wed: Watched NVIDIA panel with “Attention is all you need” authors”. Iterated Harmony Portfolio with Alaina. Tested Claude 3 resume ranking.

2024-03-19 Tue: Attended NVIDIA GTC. Continued monitoring HIP-32, unanimous YES! Research into [Keep3r and KeeperDAO](https://docs.keep3r.network/) project and tokenomics to apply to job recruiters.  

2024-03-18 Mon: Continued research on AiMM, helped Alaina with Harmony Portfolio mocks.

---

2024-03-17 Sun: Market research on [AiMM](harmony.one/aimm). Looking into Ploymarket, specifically prediction market for salary and candidates. Insights: polymarket is banned in the US, decentralized matchmaking for the job industry may be a better solution than prediction markets. [5hr]

2024-03-16 Sat: Continued search for voice first AI products or models. Insight: reinforcement learning is limited to the foundational knowledge base, AGI will need an [abstract layer](https://medium.com/autonomous-agents/enhancing-llms-reasoning-through-jepa-a-comprehensive-mathematical-deep-dive-301ec9c4d6f2). [3hr]

2024-03-15 Fri: Meeting with Li. Formatting for deliverables, Nagesh and Ivan adding shortly. Testing Claude 3 1bot release. Insights: missing web search and subagents that gets the most out of Claude 3 Opus.

2024-03-14 Thu: Concluded 2-week deliverables for team. Helped Rika with smart contracts for story protocol using Julia’s notion.

2024-03-13 Wed: Call with Artem and Frank for 2-week deliverables. Sync with Stephen and Julia for potential voice foundational direction. Contacted Stanford open source AI summit and community members for decks and additional information on crypto AI data companies.

2024-03-12 Tue: Meeting with DIA for alternative oracle solution to add options for dapps. Insight: Their architecture directly provides a solution to the previous oracles issue regarding the bridge hack. Documents will be shared tomorrow EOD. Long meeting with Stephen to align team for next two weeks of deliverables.

2024-03-11 Mon: Moved progress from /x and /s to /h. Scheduled call with DIA for alternative oracle providers to boost support on Harmony. Insight: Investigating JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) for voice synthesis could be valuable following the video of [Lex Fridman with Yann LeCun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t1vTLU7s40), as its focus on predicting missing segments and learning semantic relationships in the audio signal might lead to improved control over traditional LLMs.

---

2024-03-10 Sun: Further look into providing valuable data for LLMs,resulting in a significant model improvement. Insight: Quality over quantity is the best approach to voice data. [Apple model improvements](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/personal-voice). We may need to create a new performance benchmark as a standard, Word Error Rate (WER) does not account for natural sounding speech, and Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is an aggregated score of human listeners, quantifying MOS could be great for the entire synthesis space as we move forward. (7hr)

2024-03-09 Sat: Joskins coordination for increased awareness. Shared announcement with Alaina. (1hr)

2024-03-08 Fri: Created content for Envio announcement for partnership.

2024-03-07 Thu: Transition of direction to research specific data providers for models. High level aim is to verify data quality or quantity to achieve 1-10% voice synthesis model performance. Meeting with Envio to plan next week’s announcements and potential twitter spaces.

2024-03-06 Wed: Deep dive into Bittensor architecture and whitepaper, focusing on data component. Insight: End goal of bittensor is decentralized compute for entire model itself, they have a limit at 32 subnets that each consist of a unique model, not strictly at the data collection optimization layer of the model. 

2024-03-05 Tue: Research leading crypto and AI intersections who appeared at EthDenver. Morpheus, Bittensor, 0g, Near, Semiotic Lab, etc.

2024-03-04 Mon: Multiple longer meetings with Stephen and team for Q2 planning and EthDenver recap. Sync with Artem and Yuriy about Bitcoin and AI narratives. 

---

**1. Harmony Shard 1 Data Optimization:**

Analyze how other blockchains make their data readily accessible, focusing on scalability and cost-reduction strategies. Our goal is to adapt these best practices to Harmony Shard 1, resulting in seamless data access and ultra-fast transactions, supercharging the development of powerful dApps on our platform. Zero knowledge proofs may also be implemented to ensure optimal security and privacy.

**3. Social A(G)I for Better Human Connections:**

A concept that makes sense with the Harmony ethos. Embrace the concept of "Social A(G)I" to guide Harmony's future development. This means understanding users' desire for genuine connection in Web2 or Web3 and integrating tools that facilitate meaningful interactions and community building. The goal is a user experience that enhances human connection rather than detracting from it.

**4.  Babylon + Bitcoin:**

Explore how Babylon can provide Harmony users holding Bitcoin the opportunity to earn Harmony yields while simultaneously bolstering our network security. Let's assess the technical feasibility between Bitcoin's hashrate and Harmony's consensus mechanisms for increased resilience. Staking on Harmony should also get an uprgade, auto-restaking, customized reward collection (i.e. rewards collected could be automated directly to liquidity in a Swap liquidity pool), efficient multi-delegration and undelegation, etc.

**5. 'Build on Bitcoin' Expansion:** 

Conceptualize ways to move beyond simple Bitcoin swaps and create a comprehensive Bitcoin platform on Harmony. Think Thorchain on steroids. We should aim for a robust suite of DeFi protocols or portfolio management services, positioning Harmony as a leader in Bitcoin innovation.

**2. cookbook.dev post EthDenver Launch:**

Partner with cookbook.dev to connect their AI-powered documentation platform to Harmony. Pilot this integration within their beta program to gather developer feedback and showcase the benefits to a wider audience. This will make building on Harmony easier, attracting more talent to our ecosystem.

**6. Ecosystem Refinement and User Growth:**

Gather focused feedback from users engaging with Harmony's existing projects to identify pain points and areas for improvement. Prioritize development based on data-driven insights to enhance user experience and satisfaction across the ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to make our existing projects irresistible to a wider audience. (.country, Voice AI, 1Bot, Human Protocol, Swap, Lend, Stacking Dashboard, Explorer, etc.)

---

On-going: One tweet + two replies per day, 365/7 all the time.

---

2024-03-03 Sun: Continued research on post EthDenver initiatives and how we can bring them to Harmony. As well as continuing to improve our current ecosystem. Insight: Lend needs incentivized lending and liquidity, Stacking needs auto-restocking and further rewards customization. (4hr)

2024-03-02 Sat: Updated remote team on changes following EthDenver to continue into Q2.(1hr)

2024-03-01 Fri: Transition into $voice and $map, coordination with Frank to move from h.country onto voice and map data.

2024-02-19 Mon: Harmony Ecosystem Roundup speaker. Continued Human-Protocol product development. (1hr) Insights for specific UI/UX. Needs: First Hash Page: add wording to tell user what to do, pre-fill links with placeholder names like Twitter and Telegram. We are missing a DRIVE TO ACTION as people use the application and reach the end of the flow they are left wondering “What next?” creating a funnel to a specific use or interaction within or outside of the app will be ideal.  

---

2024-02-18 Sun: Practiced 30-sec walkthrough of Human-Protocol and user flows with outside users. (5hr) Insights: Current flow is heavily dependent on someone looking over their shoulder, without it user is quickly lost. With help the user understands the flow, but when left alone to continue using it there is a drop-off. Resolution: SIMPLIFY. When explained to the user, the core features make sense, but when left alone it is clear the UI/UX needs changes to ease the user through the product.

2024-02-17 Sat: [Brief product requirement document](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Stripped-Down-PRD-for-Human-Protocol-30e7a6aa2fdf4e12a7fd2432969087f7?pvs=4) to show stripped down core functionality of Human-Protocol. (1hr)

Insights: strong nft community from solana is what is carrying inscriptions, some token generations as well but nothing yet in terms of strong utility. Main tool, [LiberPlex](https://www.libreplex.io/) lacking in quality, UI/UX. Main volume from Tensor and MagicEden.  [3hr]

2024-01-19 Fri: Early morning on-call assisting with mint. SQL analytics for onescription mint. Ecosystem lottery implementation discussions. Further inscription plans and personnel allocation for 2024 roadmap tasks.

2024-01-18 Thu: Prototyped pool-based flip architecture for optimized liquidity and decentralization with Julia.  

2024-01-17 Wed: Technical calls with partners. Speaker for [twitter space with Gateway X](https://x.com/GatewayX_one/status/1747825674524704880?s=20).

2024-01-16 Tue: Launch plan and coordination with internal team and external partners. Continued development for [inscription tools](https://hmy-inscription.web.app/) and eventually [i.country](https://i.country).

2024-01-15 Mon: Federal Holiday

2024-01-14 Sun: EthDenver content for applications. [1hr]

2024-01-13 Sat: Flip custodians allocation and discussions. [2hr]

2024-01-12 Fri: Released 2024 roadmap and twitter threads.

2024-01-11 Thu: Completed Roadmap 2024, ready for substack release. 

2024-01-10 Wed: Completed successful OneBitFlip proof-of-concept with Julia. Inscribed x.1 and 1.country. Reached out to potential Flip custodians. iOS Safe Multisig development underway.

2024-01-09 Tue: Ran Tuesday Dev call, sync for prioritization, native USDC (Base) and ONE (Harmony) swap or “flip” as it contains no smart contract signing or bridging will be the first release. Completed a draft of 2024 announcement and site copy for USDC/ONE flip. Coded template for 1bot landing page, helped Alaina with walkthrough guide.

2024-01-08 Mon: Roadmapping and interview session with Stephen. Participated in HER space #13.

2024-01-07 Sun: Added metablox to Dapp Overview. Deep dive for Thorchain and Chainflip. Insight: Still early for chainflip, but JIT AMM (Just-in-time automated market maker) currently has the edge on the technical side for capital efficiency. Thorchain currently has millions more in liquidity and volume, chainflip is only just starting having released [pre-release swaps](https://x.com/Chainflip/status/1736796878807683141?s=20) 2 weeks ago ($1k USD single swap limit). Heavy fee hit on BTC, best for larger swaps. [4hr]

2024-01-06 Sat: Updated dapp overview, curated list of active validators, sync with knights&peasants for giveaway. Reviewed delphi digital "year in review" reports. [4hr]

2024-01-05 Fri: Synced with Casey for recovery and lend. Coordinated with custodians for [Round 15](https://x.com/recoveryonefdn/status/1743515190463791354?s=20).

2024-01-04 Thu: Granted access to gnosis group, awaiting response for official integration update. No respponse from Dune, current best option is [data request](https://feedback.dune.com/data-request/p/add-support-for-harmony-protocol).

2024-01-03 Wed: Reached out for Dune listing on [data request form](https://feedback.dune.com/data-request/p/add-support-for-harmony-protocol), discord, and support email. AAG admins figuring out bridge tvl inquiry. Waiting on gnosis contact for official listing. Continued Dapp overview updates and project outreach.

2024-01-02 Tue: Added Knights & Peasants to dapp overview. Handed-off [CreateX deploy](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/createx) issue to Casey. Continued research on Anoma, key insight: heavy burden on author of intents. Anoma and other "intent-centric" projects depend on either quality intents, or the quality of the handling of those intents. Most immediate valuable use case: [Multi-Party Bartering](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/wtf-is-anoma-part-1-wtf-are-intents#intents-arent-just-limit-orders-e458). 

2024-01-01 Mon: Reviewed Galaxii and updated dapp overview. More testing of uniswap x, centralization risk with more than 70% of fill orders coming from Wintermute or Tokka Labs.

2023-12-31 Sun: Tested Uniswap X. Key insights: Best suited for high liquidity swaps. Most swaps under $10k do not benefit from the gas-free transactions. Uniswap X routing favors trading pairs with significant volume and liquidity. Maximum Extractable Value [(MEV) protection](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/front-running) through their [Dutch Limit Order Reactor](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Uniswap-X-2ebfe67b5ccc4c44a7b704f1376c457e?pvs=4), combined with "[fillers](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/uniswapx/guides/createfiller)" covering the gas fee, makes Uniswap X optimal for general, high-liquidity swapping and less effective for MEV traders. [2hr]

2023-12-30 Sat: Tested Multibit bridge, bridged $MUBI (ERC-20) very clean UI/UX and smooth transfer. Unknown technicals and poses a risk. Also, 0.03 ETH service fee is quite high. [2hr]

2023-12-29 Fri: Joined telegram groups and conducted market research for [MultiBit](https://multibit.exchange/) and [Ordizk](https://ordizk.io/) for BRC-20 to EVM bridges, will test over the weekend. Initial thoughts: both look promising in what they say they can deliver but their telegram groups, lack of public repos, and lack of technical information is worrisome.

2023-12-28 Thu: Completed initial [Harmony Dapp Overview](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Harmony-Dapp-Overview-fc7a6a82e65540278d3e2951e0262398?pvs=4), drafting tweet to share with community. Used phantom wallet to test and research top wallets, will move to open source to see if anything is comparable.

2023-12-27 Wed: Started initial [Harmony Dapp Overview](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Harmony-Dapp-Overview-fc7a6a82e65540278d3e2951e0262398?pvs=4), will continue to add more tomorrow. 

2023-12-26 Tue: Spoke with Eugene from marscolony about nft marketplace following nftkey's dissolution. Completed review of Avalanche specific inscriptions "avascriptions" compared to the greater space. Still not seeing much in the inscription ultility department but more may come later. Today, 3.4m transactions came solely from an inscription token called "ShenLong" with a 1 mint token limit per transaction. Wary of connecting directly to avascriptions.com but minting directly should be much safer by design of inscriptions (no smart contract signatores needed).

2023-12-25 Mon: Christmas

---

2023-12-24 Sun: Researched different Ordinals projects, joined a free mint for [bitblocks](https://twitter.com/billyrestey) from twitter user "billy". DeFi wave for bitcoin that may follow the memes and brc-20 craze will be interesting to watch. Phantom and other dapps/wallets as well as exchanges like [OKX](https://www.okx.com/web3/hot/inscription) are preparring themselves well for an increase in bitcoin adoption. [2hr]

2023-12-23 Sat: Joined Ethereum, Polygon, Degen, AI, and Arbitrum channels on warpcast. Ethereum has the largest community out of all of them by quite some margin (16k members, closest is AI with ~4k). Insight for today: Quility UI/UX posts explaining the need for simplicity in the web3 space, more is not always better. [1hr]

2023-12-22 Fri: Joined warpcast. Read through inscription posts as well. Warpcast community still wondering about the utility for inscriptions outside of bitcoin. Room for more inscription use cases on evm chains, must be more than memetic oriented for sustained adoption.

2023-12-21 Thu: Posted instcriptions guide on [X](https://x.com/theoperisic/status/1737359794963677462?s=20). Completed NFT [analysis between Moonbirdgs and PudgeyPenguins](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Pudgy-Penguins-vs-MoonBirds-1c8f2ec1bcf5436e83cbf9b4526e56e0?pvs=4), interesting proof of concept that shows "community > product" in web3 business models.

2023-12-20 Wed: Looked over Casey's announcement forum post. Spent today at investors lunch with Stephen. Interesting insights in gamefi coming soon and early alpha on first playstation web3 game. Intersection of crypto and AI still a valuable opportunity. 

2023-12-19 Tue: Continued work with Inscriptions. Completed [image inscriptions guide](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Harmony-Inscription-Process-e3e43a20835c4a3b88cb5d8f22f9b784?pvs=4). Successful inscription using CLI on Sun’s build, waiting for pull request merge for main build.

2023-12-18 Mon: Experimenting with inscriptions on Harmony. Created an [image inscription](https://explorer.harmony.one/tx/0xba7fa5573ad86a69fb980c228d7297c361e3b99b5f56a6ec8ae328aa0f299d89) using metamask and text based json as well. Completed [general analysis](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Inscriptions-f16f5cb08c054cc688ace7673698a4a1?pvs=4) of non-bitcoin inscription projects.

---

2023-12-17 Sun: Catching up on messages and team updates, will continue on Monday. Reached out to metamask contact for metamask portfolio listing. [1hr]

2023-12-16 Sat: Showcased Voice AI app for group of 10, insights: I downloaded most recent version of the app and without internal context I found it to be very confusing to navigate and showcase to people. The app has also taken a turn to becoming overcomplicated. Current structure is a generalized application of openai’s gpt 4 that allows a single app to satisfy many different use cases, an alternative approach may be to highly specialize the app for a single use case. [2hr]

2023-12-11 Mon - 2023-12-15 Fri: Paid time off

---

2023-12-10 Sun: General Harmony overview and communications with the community. [1hr]

2023-12-09 Sat: App testing, insight: noticed I most frequently use the app for a quick inquiry about a fact or interesting information that is lacking in a moment or a conversation. Using the additional feature of “Surprise Me!” far less. [2hr]

2023-12-08 Fri: v1.1208.18 (Updated transcript logs) Mapped full perceived latency benchmarks using [Aaron’s docs](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/blob/main/doc/benchmarking.md), synced with Yuriy for implementation.

2023-12-07 Thu: v1.1207.18 (TimeLogger improvements) Detailed potential focus split for 2024 project roadmap.

2023-12-06 Wed: v1.1206.18 (10MB limit for sharing transcription, “Pause/Play” font alignment and icons update). Updated quickfacts custom instruction [#322](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/pull/322). Reviewed Sudoswap amm nft platform. [Tweeted](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1732482500482789880?s=20) weekly protocol updates. 

2023-12-05 Tue: v1.1205.18 (Improved haptic feedback for “Press & Hold”). Worked with Alaina for the social media videos.

2023-12-04 Mon: v1.1204.18 (iPhone 15 Action Button support for "Surprise Me!", check implemented for empty "Surprise Me!" result). Completed new x code review.

---

2023-12-03 Sun: Extensive review of x codebase. [6hr]

2023-12-02 Sat: General app testing of latest version. Key insight: "Hey" loses personalization of the app that might draw user back in. Suggested implementation: Additional to "System Settings" or "Custom Instructions", "User Profile" where the user describes themselves and it is added to the context. [1hr]

2023-12-01 Fri: Deployed 1.1201.18 (Updated action sheets, iPad misconfiguration resolved). Created script for finding “[canned responses](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Canned-Responses-08c2a748e67b4da0bf8c05c817c17911?pvs=4)” throughout codebase. 

2023-11-30 Thu: Deployed 1.1130.18 (Context increase 500 -> 8000, Language support now 183). Continued testing smaller models, Mistral and Llama 7b via Ollama. Insights: Llama 7b more verbose but unreliable. Mistral much more consistent at following instructions and fast outputs. GPT-3.5 still the clear winner, but for on-device efficiency and cost optimization, Mistral seems best suited.

2023-11-29 Wed: Deployed 1.1129.18, key change: In-App purchase backend handling improvements. Started [testing Mistral 7b](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Mistral-7b-Testing-4c0512d7106b41ed8321204268d79eb4?pvs=4) locally for upcoming complete on-device build for latency optimization and improved availability. 

2023-11-28 Tue: Deployed 1.1128.18 to TestFlight build, key changes: (Sun) fixed expiration update [bug](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/commit/51c175aaa66b0e460e555d39972b74db1254732a) and (Yuriy) added refactoring [optimization](https://github.com/harmony-one/x/pull/277). Completed set of [3 predefined custom instructions](https://harmonyone.notion.site/3-Predefined-Custom-Instructions-b36546c4ee544aea8168c7f046c476c5?pvs=4).

2023-11-27 Mon: Deployed 1.1127.18 to TestFlight build. Created [Voice AI demo questions](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Voice-AI-Demo-Questions-276e9075c0904d4997c6645557d1b10b?pvs=4) and engineered prompts to output various examples.

---

2023-11-26 Sun: Worked with OpenAIs Assistants API, useful for incorporating our own information, Harmony specific, as well as performing tasks like sending a message or interacting with zappier. Insight: pricing is way too high for the lack of consistency of outputs. Focusing on mastering the quickest smart companion seems to be the best direction at the moment. Potential pivot to smaller LLM to distance from openai and fine tune for use cases specific to a low latency companion needs addressing based on pricing, speed, and dependency on openai. [4hr]

2023-11-25 Sat: Used the app and thought of different ways to increase user retention. Insight: Hand hold the user to a specific app interaction through a specific button. (Daily Trivia, Cooking Assistant, or Quick Ideation) these use cases must highlight the low latency capabilities of the app as this is the main value proposition at the moment. [1hr]

2023-11-24 Fri: Following discussions, drafted simple [gamification elements](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Gamification-for-Voice-AI-3ff4489eb71a42649073e2806a2f939c?pvs=4) and options to improve [user retention](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Improving-User-Retention-2f6b2f3c2c47466b82e93f0b92916e79?pvs=4) as active users has dropped significantly.

2023-11-23 Thu: Thanksgiving, user testing for voice ai app with 20 people. App insight: (12) people were impressed with the speed, (17) don’t like the voice, (11) mentioned they would use it in the kitchen if there was a hands-free mode.

2023-11-22 Wed: Deployed 1.1122.18 to TestFlight build. App insight: current app structure is too broad for user retention, internal users are the only users coming back.

2023-11-21 Tue: Deployed 1.1121.18 to Voice 2 build. Added [Thanksgiving marketing copy](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Thanksgiving-Marketing-Campaign-f4e2ff42dd7e4c78946722e4b64244f2?pvs=4) to Alaina’s graphic. Tested processing logic for [Harmony specific information](https://harmonyone.notion.site/HarmonyGPT-b517a68bce564ac68cebd378b5d420e2?pvs=4) without the need of memory.

2023-11-20 Mon: Deployed 1.1120.18 public TestFlight build. Created and added full [Terms](https://x.country/terms), Privacy, and Copyright for Apple Pay build.

---

2023-11-19 Sun: Completed potential [Thanksgiving marketing campaign](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Thanksgiving-Marketing-Campaign-f4e2ff42dd7e4c78946722e4b64244f2?pvs=4). [1hr]

2023-10-25 Wed: Started collecting [in-office feedback](https://harmonyone.notion.site/OpenAI-ChatGPT-Voice-Feedback-b92ec110c57548ff93b99d6227103011?pvs=4) for OpenAI ChatGPT voice mode. Went over [marketing strategy and copy](https://voiceai.substack.com/p/voice-ai-talk-with-chatgpt4-on-apple) with Stephen for Voice AI. Continued testing golden paths and added instructions for [interactive storytelling](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Custom-Instructions-2e3ff8d9e9254c039e2d253ad18ec6a1?pvs=4).

---

2023-10-22 Sun: Product testing for Chatgpt, Hey Sam, and [Play.ht's new 2.0 launch](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/playht).

2023-10-21 Sat: Coordinated with Aaron for App Manager access for Hey Sam. Added character lengths for each section and useful links for the [application process](https://harmonyone.notion.site/App-Store-Project-Intro-Product-Details-Screen-Mocks-a3dcb50d30654c508779b123d278546f?pvs=4).

2023-10-20 Fri: Started information compilation for [App Store application process here](https://harmonyone.notion.site/App-Store-Project-Intro-Product-Details-Screen-Mocks-a3dcb50d30654c508779b123d278546f?pvs=4). Wrote [first draft](https://harmonyone.notion.site/App-Store-Description-DRAFT-b56cd5582a134ba192de1fd09cc239c2?pvs=4) of App Store description for “Hey Sam”.  Deep dive with Labhesh on Replika and which knowledge models are best to use for getting past OpenAI guardrails. Mistral and Falcon 7b are potential starting points.
