Q3 Review:

This quarter was focused on key marketing campaigns, partnerships, designing graphics, and competitor testing. I led co-marketing campaigns for Three Sigma, Blockscout, Layer Zero, Kings and Quests, ONE Show, Flappyh1, #cryptoisboring with Band Protocol and internal projects like Hod1, Human Protocol, GX.Country, TGI Podcasts, 1bot, and 1Market. These campaigns generated 833,000 impressions and raised engagement by 4% from last quarter, reaching a total engagement rate of 3.9%.

I also revised the 1bot user guide and actively assisted with onboarding community members. I worked 1-on-1 with users, guiding them through the process of purchasing ONE and utilizing 1bot, while keeping them engaged in the ONE Bot Love group. Additionally, I tested competitor products like Hamster Kombat, Polymarket, and Pump.fun to contribute insights, questions, and commentary for our 2025 Roadmap.

Met with Li, Sun, and Artem and finalized my Q3 review.

2024-09-24 Tue: Tested and filmed a tutorial on /o1 on ONE Bot. Insights: /o1 works swiftly and effectively. The true value is in the ability to 'pay per use'. Perhaps the differnce in cost, if there is one, should be more accessible to users of ONE Bot. Currently, its difficult to see how much each feature costs. I also sketched up variations of a vector logo for Kings and Quests. Re-editing of all logos on the home page to correct spacing. 

2024-09-23 Mon: Kings and Quests Video [promotion](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1838323096538988883). Drafted and collected data for my Q3 Review. Design of more marketing materials for #cryptoisboring.

2024-09-10 Tue: Sync with Frank on DOGS bot. Insights: Despite have issues connecting our wallet, I notice a pattern between successful Telegram Bots (like Hamster Kombat).

2024-09-09 Mon: Testing of Polymarket, placed bets on 2 political aspects of tomorrows debate. Insights: The interface is engaging, drawing you in with a wide variety of bets.

Tweeted first thread on the roadmap. Testing of ideogram, insights include: Midjourney is still the topic image generator in terms of high detail and artistry.

Q3 Review Draft:
This quarter focused on key marketing campaigns, graphics, partnerships, and competitor testing. I led campaigns for #cryptoisboring with Band Protocol, Three Sigma, Blockscout, Layer Zero, Kings and Quests, ONE Show, Flappyh1, and internal projects like Hod1, Human Protocol, GX.Country, TGI Podcasts, 1bot, and 1Market. These campaigns generated 833,000 impressions, and overall, our engagement on X increased by 4% from last quarter, reaching 3.9%.

I also revised the 1bot user guide to ensure smooth functionality and communicated feature and functionality updates to the community.

Additionally, I tested competitor products like Hamster Kombat, Polymarket, and Pump.fun to deliver insights and questions to the 2025 Product Roadmap.

Purchased more credits to test Gen 3 on Runway, insights: it's too tedious testing generation by generation, with clear direction employing a script to [automate the generations](https://useapi.net/docs/articles/runway-bash) (with an unlimited subscription) is the easiest way to get several generations. 

2024-08-12 Mon: [Thread](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1823096082878071005) on the relation between the yen, US dollar, and BTC. Editing of ONE Show episode 9, to be uploaded tomorrow.

I coordinated with @Tenacious_DeFi to produce, edit, upload, and curate questions for [episodes 1-5 of the ONE Show](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzkb1vJXQOTniPiEMg5gy9xpIIt5BC48&si=VB8y7bnyXMX_S8dY), which averages 350 views per video on Youtube and 361 listeners on X. 

Also, I led a community Twitter space with Swoop, attended by 97 community members. I tweeted daily to engage community partners to co-market products within the Harmony ecosystem. These include [Galaxii](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1797785935704174611), [Coinmonster Merch](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1782220916489097342) [Blockscout Testnet](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1790796723704807469), [Joskins NFT marketplace](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1796287489239568890), [GPT4-o on One Bot](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1795951553024565259), [$1M Swap milestone](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1781097509005488620).

---

**2024 scope**

On-going: One tweet + two replies per day, 365/7 all the time.

My focus will be on enhancing our community engagement and boosting our social media presence by actively managing daily interactions and content. I'll post daily on platforms like X, Substack, and YouTube to highlight our partnerships, ecosystem news, and demos of AI-driven products like ONE Bot and ONE Portfolio. I will engage with our community through two daily replies and foster discussions in community spaces. Additionally, I will post educational content to help users understand the current crypto + AI landscape and how our products are innovating within that space. I will collaborate with the community to host regular calls, inviting guest speakers to share insights and discuss relevant topics. I will also continue to iterate and improve ONE Portfolio, incorporating feedback from the team and community. My success will be measured by increased user engagement, positive feedback on our AI developments, and active community participation. 

-----

**2024 Q1 Review (83.5 hours)**

In Q1, I drove our Twitter engagement significantly, recording an 88% increase in activity, 27% more impressions, and maintaining a 4.0% engagement rate. This effort resulted in higher link clicks, retweets, and likes, reflecting robust community engagement. Our Substack saw steady traffic, slightly decreasing views but improving open rates, despite fewer postings.

On YouTube, we saw a 26% rise in views and a 90% jump in watch time, highlighting our successful content strategy that included new videos and shorts. I also managed projects solo, enhancing our Figma iterations and taking initiative in areas like project management and content creation, which included redesigning thumbnails and improving video editing skills.

2024-01-12 Fri: Paid time off.

2024-01-11 Thu: Reviewing [Substack post](https://blog.harmony.one/p/harmony-2024-one-finality) and sharing via twitter.

Sticking to monocolor, simple copy, to start. Will considering future addition of a 'statement' piece/image behind the interface. But for now, sticking to as-simple-as-possible streamlined user experience.

2023-12-18 Mon: Researched top bridging platforms, using bridge aggregator. Found inspiration from Hop.exchange for it's brand similarity and simplicity. Also found inspiration from Stargate for it's design & color simplicity. Tested Harmony bridge & began drafting revisions of information layout. All can be seen in this [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/qDg2rk0BivJwe98nM0l1gN/Bridge.harmony.one?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=OwVErw2fvA5EmdY5-1).

Wrote [thread](https://x.com/des1gnsoup/status/1731817869032497358?s=20) showcasing my VoiceAI demo and [updated community](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1731852556736090298?s=20) on the launch of Lend. Finalized and reviewed [feedback from Kratos](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-Feedback-92a1bca02faf433c8d1fd71bf8277be3?pvs=4#65f06384d6d04a2787774f75429b8062) on Voice AI.

-----

2023-12-03 Sun: Updated [community section](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Harmony-ONE-211747cea4e240248d941496ee203be8?pvs=4#48bdedabbb904005a4949a4c92b107cd) on harmony.one website, and shared links with TGI group. Retweeted NowNode's [thread (https://x.com/NOWNodes/status/1731670991481286764?s=20). Added more videos to [VoiceAI Demos](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/VoiceAI-Demos-586e43d0cfbc414f94e38b5974104c2a).

2023-12-01 Fri: Synced with NowNodes, helped them to refine copy for a thread they're tweeting next week. Synced with DappRadar about the update to our subscription. Press and Hold was not functional on VoiceAI, so I filmed user tests using solely 'tap to speak'. I was able to film [videos](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/VoiceAI-Demos-586e43d0cfbc414f94e38b5974104c2a?pvs=4) without highlighting 'surprise me' but the responses were still lengthy and subpar. I worked with Theo to draft custom instructions & noticed it's inconvenient to input/delete instructions in the settings. You can't view all the custom instructions and secondly the automatic custom instructions don't autofill after changing. 

2023-11-30 Thu: Wrote thread to promote ONE Bots image to image logo generations, but noticed the feature /image --c 3 was no longer workiing. Forwarded issues to Frank and Yuriy for review. Experimented more golden paths for demos, yet unfortunately the local version of VoiceAI wasn't working on my phone. I wrote scripts to showcase musical history, Harmony knowledge, cooking knowledge, and a language learning version.

2023-11-29 Wed: Wrote [Twitter thread](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1729942794612150510?s=20) promoting 'More Actions'. Filmed demos for Youtube shorts, but noticed VoiceAI was still not working on my iPhone11. Sent all my demos to eng team to understand the bugs. I attempted to record one in Spanish, but Apple's text to speech did not provide an impressive response. Installed local version on my iPhone & continued testing. 

2023-11-28 Tue: Resolving image to image issues on ONE Bot with engineering team, ONE Bot was auto refunding payments. Wrote a twitter thread on image to image generation that will be published following the fix. Did a user testing session with Rika, found that users would appreciate if ONE Bot could teach them how to use the app. Currently, the app says it can handle tasks like "managing calendars and setting reminders" which isn't true. 

2023-11-27 Mon: Worked with Theo P to test ['golden paths' for YT shorts](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Voice-AI-Demo-Questions-276e9075c0904d4997c6645557d1b10b?pvs=4). VoiceAI was glitchy, not responding to queries, responding with irrelevant answers, making it difficult to film a cohesive short. Questions about Harmony protocol were also incorrect, tap to speak was delayed. I'm considering my older iphone may be causing issues, so I will refilm on my iPad.

-----

2023-11-25 Sun: User tested VoiceAI with friends, who found it useful for practicing pitching services to clients. Demoed more image generetaion in One Bot Love. Updated more Substack titles to read more interestingly, such as [the HIP 30v2 article](https://blog.harmony.one/p/hip30v2-update-announcement) and [Q3 Engineering Report](https://blog.harmony.one/publish/posts/detail/138024346/share-center).

2023-11-24 Fri: Updated harmony.one community section. Rewriting Substack titles to be more click-worthy, specific, and informative. Updated [iphone/ipad mocks](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=466%3A267&mode=design&t=QGGUGbxEsXLbhziu-1) for app store and uploaded to App Store Connect for next version release.

2023-11-23 Thu: Thanksgiving Holiday

2023-11-22 Wed: Synced with Theo on VoiceAI feature updates, selected new icon for 'More Actions' command. Integrated the icon into a [new vertical mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=454%3A2&mode=design&t=VHD9TygMOBGw9GNr-1). Shared Thanksgiving based promotions with Harmony community on Telegram and on ONE Bot love. User tested Voice AI with my family.

2023-11-21 Tue: PTO

2023-11-20 Mon: Remade and uploaded iPad app store screenshots, resolved blurry press to speak icon. Corresponded with Kratos & sent a questionaire about his user feedback for VoiceAI. Synced with Theo P on Thanksgiving marketing efforts, generated some [posts](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#69f5fda9ce534b07ac8f6b38c490fdac) in DALLE3, which still need refining.

2023-11-19 Sun: Animated a graphic with mockups for twitter. Wrote & tweeted 2 threads: A user guide [thread](https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1726409136328544438?s=20) & a [thread](https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1726411171694317894?s=20) answering "How does VoiceAI compare to whisper?". Sent a message to the Harmony community on telegram promoting VoiceAI's launch. Tested VoiceAI & noticed font color changes (looks lighter than it's supposed to be) and also noticed the "Tap to Speak" button is a different color than the Press and Hold. Messaged Frank to correct these issues.

2023-11-17 Fri: Generated [assets](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#b74c48ed794c41bcaea92d226b276052) for VoiceAI on Dalle, in the style of the comic from the Wall St. Journal. I updated the in-app screenshot previews on the app store. Synced with the engineers to fix the circle icon & synced with Rika on the questions and answers about Harmony to be answered by VoiceAI. Addressed the in office storage situation, but decided with Stephen to leave the boxes as is, until we're hosting TGI events again.

2023-11-16 Thu: Spoke with 15 friends and family and onboarded them onto Voice AI, user tested with my sister and boyfriend. Feedback included that they enjoyed the speed of the replies, enjoyed the color scheme, and had fun playing with custom instructions. I animated a graphic for our [Twitter posting](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1725257682117128514?s=20) of the app store launch and wrote a thread promoting the launch. I worked in Photoshop Beta to create more [graphics](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#25a89abf133b444bb620df75cf11009f) for Voice AI.

2023-11-15 Wed: User-tested with Diego. His [feedback](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-Feedback-92a1bca02faf433c8d1fd71bf8277be3?pvs=4#9b149ad9e2b746639f9bcf01efcb6c94) on voice AI was that he enjoyed how our voice catered to his regional accent whereas most voice tools only use standard American accent. He expressed the press to speak button was hard to feel sure Voice AI was listening. He described the buttons 'beeping' feedback was lagging and distracting. He felt you only get feedback that it was listening after you've completed your thought because it beeps 1-2 seconds following your question. I also purchased a storage solution with Amanda to rid our office of boxes & set up a tea subscription. Drafted a series of test questions for Voice AI & experiemented with image to [video generation on Runway](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#70746865c79e4a8681c69f57aed56805).

2023-11-14 Tue: Interviewed Bryan for the tech lead role. Synced with engineers to repair /ask and image generation on ONE Bot, both issues were resolved. Interacted with ONE Bot Love community, sharing image generations with chatgpt prompts. Browsed icon libraries for the Lend logo, noticed most other web3 lending platforms have logos that are completely unrelated to the concept of lending. Merged DALLE 3 generations on Photoshop, to create a [graphic](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-DALLE-assets-393b0e9504024554b7b5eb7a65d7fdc6?pvs=4#0029afa7ef1b45d5b6ba798b6851897b) that embodies Voice AI use cases... and am continuing to iterate more focusing on the user driving and speaking to their phone vs. using it on a subway during a commute. 

2023-11-13 Mon: Updated harmony.one, adding 'Lend' and removing Defira and updating the community section. Responded to ONE Bot users via Twitter asking how to train their own models. Filmed a screen-recorded demo, but encountered issues as ONE Bot image generation was down. [Cross-posted Voice AI's substack onto Harmony's](https://blog.harmony.one/cp/138847393), another is to be cross posted on Friday. During my testing sessions, Voice AI had to be refreshed because I was able to 'break' it. Spamming buttons & interrupting 'Sam' is how I continually broke it.

2023-11-12 Sun: Synced with Frank to update Voice AI fontface from regular to bold, a change that occured once we implemented the darker background. Created a gif for the [Lend documentation](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Welcome-to-Lend-Docs-739d2643f9a74ee9a4f6672bd43213bf?pvs=4). During testing found that on the "Share with friends" button, the 'sure' and 'cancel' buttons should be flipped. Additionally, I think we can rephrase the pop up to better incentivize users to share it with friends. Simply stating "Share with Friends?" is boring and personally I'd swipe away. Questions like "Are you enjoying this app?" and having the "yes" button lead to sharing and the "no" button lead to feedback is a more engaging way to garner sharing/feedback.

2023-11-10 Fri: Onboarded Diego to Voice AI and scheduled a user interview for 11-15 Wed. Interacted with ONE Bot love community, showing them alternative ways to generate images. They currently really enjoy "/89 *some celebrity* as a Pixar character". Corrected water delivery to our office.

2023-11-09 Thu: Designed vertical/horizontal app store screenshots. Redesigned Voice AI logo with in app colors to replace Voice AI's app logo on the App Store. Had a user interview with Adam on testing Voice AI, his feedback is outlined [here](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Voice-AI-Feedback-92a1bca02faf433c8d1fd71bf8277be3?pvs=4). Animated a twitter graphic & [tweeted](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1722708040561090765?s=20) to announce $160K volume in swap and new domain of swap.harmony.one

2023-11-08 Wed: [Vectorized Voice AI Logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DIu1zfXuCh7JNzQ49oH9ezjHm_TVHEhZ/view?usp=sharing) & drafted first iteration of 'Lend' logo. It's currently a counterpart logo to 'swaps' but will be iterated upon. I animated a notion header for Lend user docs as well. Researched a variety of red colors for our Voice AI logo and found that since there's no centralized naming convention for colors apart from Pantone's, it allows us the opportunity to create a narrative for Voice AI to build our brand identity off of. Synced with Zi, researched Adobe articles, and read through Google/Apple's design guides.

2023-11-07 Tue: Synced with engineers to fix Voice AI UI, created iPad/iPhone 5.5" display screenshots for App Store submission. Finished designing Voice AI [TGI flyer](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1722338925845631126?s=20) & printed at FedEx. Prepped TGI helpers for cooking, set up TGI event, and cleaned up after.

2023-11-06 Mon: Refined [black + red mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=q7kw9s3JibtfgcVK-1) for 6pm implementation. Selected potential icon for new "Say More" button. Began drafting comic to be used on our flyer for TGI tomorrow. Created iPad mocks for App store submission.

2023-11-05 Sun: Selected 'thinking icon'. Created [mocks](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WCpvfpe3okxLLfio-1) with red/white/gray icons, I find red too overbearing so I prefer the white/gray icons. Experimented with a red & blue highlight, to be A/B tested with team. I rearranged icons, per my sync with Stephen, to improve  usability while the app is horizontal. I experimented with the icon changes suggested, like having the play and pause icons together and found it to be too busy. Having the icons alternate when the app is paused/played will not only create less busy design, but will give the user proper feedback to know if the session is paused/in play.

2023-11-04 Sat: Read Apple's [directory](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode) for designing in Dark Mode, explored their icon library for audio related icons to implement. Experimenting with styles [here](https://www.figma.com/file/kpJTkfaECXMrPy6OF7HTx9/x.country?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WCpvfpe3okxLLfio-1).

Whats the avg rental price in SF' disregarded custom instructions & redirected me to 'up to date' information. Qualitative questions "Who is the most famous soccer player" listened to custom instructions. Posted on Reddit for further advice. Synced with Amanda/Theo to set team up on ChatGPT Premium 

2023-10-30 Mon: Contacted the remote team & utilized Calendly to schedule user testing calls. Synced with remote team on steps to take prior to our call. Prepared topics of discussion for testing. Spent 30 mins on Whisper and 15 on VoiceAI, feedback can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Alaina-fb16535018a34835a8346b74f64e1c56).
