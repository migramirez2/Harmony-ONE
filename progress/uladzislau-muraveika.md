2024-01-11 Thursday: I will be on vacation on the 11th of January. For the rest of the week my main focus was rate-limit for the Nginx and improvement of the monitoring stack - cleaned up the old server and added a way to monitor also devnet-test node automatically via watchdog. Links: [1](https://github.com/harmony-one/ansible/pull/98) [2](https://github.com/harmony-one/ansible/pull/99)

2024-01-05 Friday: I was on vacation on the 1st of January. For the rest of the week my main focus was [Harmony faucet automation](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-ops-priv/issues/160):
1. I've spined up whole components locally and started to debug, found the root cause of broken faucet issue(wrong parameters on the start up).
2. After getting the app whole picture, I've started to automate its deployment.
3. I've covered all dependencies like:
   * nodejs from nodesource deb official repo
   * pm2 as global package to control node js service and survive restarts
   * nodemon as global package
   * encrypted secrets
   * backend npm build
   * npm fronted build and copy of static
   * latest stable nginx setup via my previously created role - [nginx_service](https://github.com/harmony-one/ansible/tree/master/playbooks/roles/nginx_service)
   * latest stable certbot setup with best SSL practices  via my previously created role - [certbot_binary](https://github.com/harmony-one/ansible/tree/master/playbooks/roles/certbot_binary)
4. As result - faucet is up and running, users were contacted in the discord about the fix and actively using it
5. I've also added uptime robot monitoring for backend and front-end
6. As final step - I've added a faucet runbook to [documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LiOowK9lXTPyPxhkAcr/s/-LlYow9k894c-0I26uAc/~/changes/1378/devops-run-book/harmony-mainnet-devops-runbook/harmony-faucet-runbook#all-in-one-deploy)

My main focus on the following week will [RPC nginx config automation](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-ops-priv/issues/162) and [rate limits for the RPC](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-ops-priv/issues/161)
