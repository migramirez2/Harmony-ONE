2024-07-08 Mon: Today I researched and fixed the cause of the exploit. I also added a Foundry PoC which showed the exploit and verified that the bug is no longer present. Some tweaking of the repo was needed to make it work with Foundry.

2024-07-09 Tue: I continued with the work on Euler V1, running all tests to make sure the addressed bug did not break anything. I continued investigating the deploy scripts, checking which modules can be omitted, what configurations are needed, and is Chainlink a must-have dependency. I ran the development deploy script to a local node.

2024-07-10 Wed: I successfully deployed Euler V1 to the testnet. Their Hardhat configuration was more difficult to set up. Then I forked every repo (Panoptic, Euler V1, Opyn Squeeth, WETH9, deploy-v3), made the necessary changes to the configs, and added Makefiles for deploying to the Harmony testnet with a single command. This makes the deployment process easier and more automated. Additionally, they will serve as a reference for the Harmony mainnet configuration.
