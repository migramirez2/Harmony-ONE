2024-01-16 Tue: The holidays are over, and it's been a busy and productive period for the team. We're gearing up for the much-anticipated 2024.1.0 forking update, which promises to introduce leader rotation alongside many enhancements to the blockchain. This update, encapsulated in pull request #4546, culminates extensive development efforts, including fixes for memory leaks, dead code, data races, and numerous optimizations and cleanups across various issues from #4539 to #4611. These improvements refine the existing functionalities and lay the groundwork for more robust and efficient operations.

This release phase, however, hasn't been without its challenges. Rigorous testing has highlighted areas needing further improvement, driving us to enhance the codebase for increased security and bug-free performance. My contributions have been centered on conducting multiple code reviews and validator tests, ensuring that each update aspect is thoroughly vetted and optimized.

In addition to these technical endeavors, I have also been revising the paper I mentioned. Though demanding, the revision process is paving the way for the release of a technical paper that will outline our ambitious plans for 2024. This paper will detail the upcoming protocol enhancements and highlight the exciting developments we have in store for the Harmony ecosystem.

2023-12-18 Mon: At Palo Alto Office last week. Besides meetings on upcoming improvements and the potential development of a game, the week primarily consisted of working on fixing a bug during the protocols undelegation process. The Hard Fork update was released last Friday, and the fork happened Sunday. A full report will be released in the coming days.

2023-12-13 Wed: Engaged in office-based meetings and synchronization sessions, focusing on technical improvements and potential enhancements to the blockchain. This involved collaborative discussions with the team, aiming to identify and plan for future advancements.

Addressed and researched several protocol issues, with updates poised for release shortly. The nature of these fixes suggests the possibility of a hardfork, with more details to be disclosed in the near future.

Progressed with the audit of the compound fork, completing code development and initiating comprehensive testing and review. Collaborating closely with the Protofire team to ensure thorough verification of the code.

Continued development of the 1-second finality code, successfully pushing the branch and commencing testing on localnet. This marks a significant step towards enhancing transaction finality speeds.

Initiated leader rotation testing on the devnet, a critical phase in ensuring the robustness and reliability of this feature within the network.

Conducted multiple code reviews, focusing on resolving inconsistencies in hash calculation across different API versions and activating leader rotation on devnet. Notably reviewed and contributed to the Initial Version of Fast Sync #4465, a significant update aimed at reducing validator syncing time.

Authored and published a comprehensive guide for users affected by hacked wallets, providing crucial assistance and information to the community. The guide is available at Harmony GitHub Issue #4585.

Continued to develop the research paper mentioned in the last update, dedicating time and effort to this ongoing project.

2023-11-20 Mon: Attended Ethereum Foundation's Devconnect in Istanbul, actively participating in panel discussions and fireside chats alongside notable figures like Vitalik Buterin. Engaged in insightful roundtables with Geth, zk, and Consensus teams. I established valuable connections with former Harmony colleagues Suede and Qi from EthStorage, Bay Area's Foresight Ventures members, and engineers from potential partner organizations Socialscan and DIA.

Completed a detailed preliminary audit of Compound's smart contracts, revealing critical issues stemming from removing the cONE token. This removal has caused significant problems across all markets, including a division by zero error, leading to market crashes. The findings and subsequent recommendations were thoroughly documented, aiming to address and rectify these issues.

Reviewed and provided feedback on several key pull requests for the Harmony blockchain. These PRs focused on vital fixes and enhancements, such as resolving last mile block issues, improving block data removal processes during rollbacks, and correcting block insertion in legacy sync. The PRs reviewed include: Fix for last mile block #4567, Rollback removes physically block data from db #4568, and Fix the block insertion in legacy sync for existing block #4565.
