Summary progress: 2/6 Tue - 2/28 Wed and 3/4 Mon - 3/10 Sun \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prototyped a social media with Firestore as the NoSQL key-value storage of messages. I titled this project Remote Emitter and added relevant features as they were brought up. First, I started by adding barebones messages sent under a user changeable username. I developed a home page where users could enter whatever username they wanted to post under and make a post. I added a timestamp and location stamp to each post. Then I added user specific pages routed under /<username>. Clicking on a username would take you to a page with all posts done from that username. I added location-specific pages as well. I worked on optimizing the storage and index methods so that updates were under 100 ms across all devices. Remote Emitter was setup to automatically deploy on-push from Cloudflare to jn.country through CNAME routing. I changed usernames to be non-user-changable, and added hashtag support (clicking on a hashtag would take you to /<hashtag> were you could see all posts that use that hashtag). Utilizing Neo4j, I was able to calculate directional nth degree connections between users. A user clicking on another user‚Äôs profile could see if there was a chain of people, that they have mutually tagged, connecting them. I tested up to a 6th degree connection with sub 400ms latency and added in the framework for a strength ranking. Later, I added mutual user of the same hashtag as a potential connection method between two nodes. I added posts and mentions tabs to profile pages and global and home feeds to the home page. I added image support and top 3 hashtags counter to the home page and user pages.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After transitioning development to h.country, I migrated a lot of the features of Remote Emitter that were relevant to the new design and direction. I started by adding in action support initially only handling tags. Messages were changes to actions in an actions Firestore collection with predefined specifications detailing how each action should be displayed and what data should go with each one. I added in timestamps and location data to the tag action and displayed it globally on home page (later removed) and on user pages. I added initial methods for link support and the first pass automatic handling of certain specific links. I started with in-line link adding but transitioned to clicking on the slash to enter any link. By specifying how certain links should be handled, I was able to match the mock‚Äôs intention of using abbreviations for certain commonly used sites. h.country was also setup to auto-deploy on-commit from Cloudflare.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sick quite a lot of this week, but following recovery, I have been looking into models that were originally trained on unlabeled voice recording data. I have been reading about experiments that teams have done measuring model improvement given more unlabeled voice data and looking into businesses that utilize these models for profit.

**Major Changes**
- [Added](https://github.com/Aishlia/remote-emitter/commit/e076cbbef889f74a4c0d6ed278b870888e7f3bd2) support for posting images.
- [Added](https://github.com/Aishlia/remote-emitter/commit/6503e1fee7b4fb9439c4c539e92b90d48817f703) connections between users that use the same hashtag. (ie. @BeautifulJewel82 ‚Üî @DeterminedXenops71 -#cats- @EnergeticHunter60 ‚Üí @UniquePiano39 ‚Üê @AncientCat37)
    - In this instance, DeterminedXenops and EnergeticHunter both used #cats in a post completing the chain between BeautifulJewel and AncientCat.
    - Mentions are considered a better connection than using hashtags so are ranked higher
    - Hashtags are treated as Hashtag nodes in graph so a path involving the same users and only mentions will be shorter.

- Removed directionality of connections (temp removal). For now, all mentions are treated as bi-directional.
- [Redesigned](https://github.com/Aishlia/remote-emitter/commit/ee36638d4b313aa92e526b7f33094c8e7b295ff0) graph data structure. Re-added connection directionality. Connection type is now stored in vertices. (@UniqueRobot65 ‚Üî @VibrantBee22 ‚Üê @ZealousWanderer97 ‚Üí @QuirkyXenops7)

- [Adjusted](https://github.com/Aishlia/remote-emitter/commit/9fe92e3dedb9a412b8234eb9e8999b39f87c228f) graph query to remove extra names. Connection chains start with the viewing user and end with the profile being viewed.
- [Add](https://github.com/Aishlia/remote-emitter/commit/b13361084841e0c67c163bfbfa2c473c9e3eb8a8) prevention of double submitting with submit state. New submitions not allowed when submit state is on.
